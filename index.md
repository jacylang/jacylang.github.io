# <span class="jacy-logo-text">Jacy</span> programming language

<span class="jacy-logo-text">Jacy</span> is a WIP experimental project aimed at easily writing low-level and high-level code using modern features.

It is mostly inspired by <span class="rust-logo">Rust</span>, other influencers are: Swift, C++, OCaml (from view of Rust), Cyclone.

Features <span class="jacy-logo-text">Jacy</span> will/does have power of:

- Functional programming:
  - Pattern matching
  - Closures (lambdas)
  - Immutable data (forced by default)
  - Algebraic Data Types
  - Parametric polymorphism
  - Affine types
- Type system:
  - Static
  - Nominal sub-typing
  - Traits (aka type classes)
- Safety:
  - Borrow checker
  - References are always valid
  - No `null`
  - No Undefined Behavior
